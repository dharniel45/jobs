# Lead Distributed Systems Engineer
## About Holonym
We are a small startup. Our flagship product, Holonym, provides privacy-preserving zero-knowledge proofs of identity for 20,000+ people. Our other product, Silk, is an alpha release of the first embeddable iframe wallet resistant to phishing, scams, malware, and key loss without trusting data custody to a third-party. We are currently building robust decentralized primitives to empower people with digital identity, especially in impoverished countries.

Our approach to the challenges in web3 involves leveraging composable and noncustodial primitives, ensuring they align with intuitive and user-friendly design patterns. We're passionate about innovating in the realms of security, privacy, and Web3 UX. Join us as we pave the way in shaping the future of digital identity and security in the Web3 space.


## Work Culture
We are a small, entirely remote team. We have a lot of fun building and innovating in the always-exciting web3 world. There is a fair amount of learning on-the-job since we operate in new cutting-edge areas.
